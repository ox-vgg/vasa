# VGG Annotation Search and Annotator

VGG Annotation Search and Annotator (VASA) is a variation of the [VGG Image Annotator (VIA) v2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) tool augmented with searching capabilities. VASA runs in a web browser and does not require any installation or setup. The complete VASA software fits in a 
single self-contained HTML page of size less than 900 Kilobyte that runs as an 
offline application in most modern web browsers. VASA is an [open source](https://gitlab.com/vgg/vasa) project developed at the [Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) (VGG) and released under the BSD-2 clause [license](https://gitlab.com/vgg/vasa/blob/master/LICENSE)
which allows it to be useful for both academic projects and commercial applications.
